## About <a name = "about"></a>
The focus of this module is on the efficient implementation
of numerical methods and algorithms for general use in any
area, but particularly high-performance computing (HPC) and
data analytics.

## Areas <a name = "areas"></a>
Within the field of mathematics, the current iteration of
implementation is focused on the following primary areas.

### Statistical Functions
The calculation of probability densities of statistical
distributions.

### Pseudo-Random Number Generation
The generation and validation of random variates suitable
for use in applications requiring randomness, such as [Monte
Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method "Monte Carlo Method - Wikipedia") simulations.

 > Note: The use case delineated above specifically applies
 only to ***non-cryptographic*** uses of the random variates
 produced by this module. **Do not use this module as the
 basis for any cryptographic application or system.**

### Numerical Computations
The derivation of numerical solutions to systems of
differential equations.
